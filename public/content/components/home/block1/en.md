## 🎯 Understanding Redirect Types

### Permanent Redirects (301 & 308)
The gold standard for SEO. Passes ~90-99% of link equity to the destination URL. Use when content has permanently moved.

### Temporary Redirects (302 & 307)
Tells search engines the move is temporary. Doesn't pass full link equity. Use for A/B testing or maintenance.

### See Other (303)
Primarily for post-form redirects. Less common for standard page redirects.

### Client-Side Redirects
**Meta Refresh & JavaScript** - Implemented in HTML/JS rather than server-level. Slower and less SEO-friendly than HTTP redirects.

## ⚡ Performance Impact

Every redirect adds 200-500ms to page load time. Here's why it matters:

- **1 redirect** = ~300ms delay → Minimal impact
- **2-3 redirects** = ~600-900ms delay → 7% bounce rate increase
- **4+ redirects** = 1000ms+ delay → 32% bounce rate increase

**Pro Tip:** Keep redirect chains under 2 hops. Each additional hop dilutes SEO value and frustrates users.

## 🔐 Security & SEO Best Practices

### Essential Security Checks
- ✅ Verify HTTPS redirects are properly implemented
- ✅ Check for HSTS headers to prevent downgrade attacks

### SEO Optimization
- ✅ Use 301/308 for permanent moves to preserve rankings
- ✅ Update internal links instead of relying on redirects
- ✅ Avoid redirect chains - go straight to final destination
- ✅ Monitor and fix redirect loops immediately
- ✅ Audit redirects quarterly to catch configuration drift
