# Redirect Analysis Specification

## Overview
Comprehensive HTTP redirect chain analysis with support for multiple redirect types and detailed metrics.

## Requirements

### Requirement: HTTP Redirect Chain Tracking
The system SHALL track complete redirect chains including all intermediate hops.

#### Scenario: Multi-hop redirect chain
- **WHEN** a URL redirects multiple times before reaching final destination
- **THEN** each hop is captured with full details
- **AND** redirect chain length is limited to 10 hops maximum

### Requirement: All HTTP Headers Captured
The system SHALL capture all HTTP response headers for each request.

#### Scenario: Headers available for analysis
- **WHEN** any redirect check is performed
- **THEN** all response headers are stored
- **AND** headers can be displayed to the user

### Requirement: JavaScript Redirect Detection
The system SHALL detect JavaScript-based redirects in page content.

#### Scenario: window.location redirect detected
- **WHEN** page contains `window.location =` or similar patterns
- **THEN** the redirect is detected and labeled as "JavaScript Redirect"

### Requirement: Meta Refresh Detection
The system SHALL detect meta refresh redirects with timing information.

#### Scenario: Meta refresh with delay
- **WHEN** page contains `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` tag
- **THEN** redirect is detected with delay time shown

### Requirement: Redirect Loop Detection
The system SHALL detect and prevent infinite redirect loops.

#### Scenario: URL redirects to itself
- **WHEN** a URL redirects back to itself or previous URL in chain
- **THEN** loop is detected and processing stops
- **AND** warning message explains the loop

### Requirement: SSL Certificate Information
The system SHALL extract SSL certificate details for HTTPS URLs.

#### Scenario: HTTPS URL with valid certificate
- **WHEN** checking an HTTPS URL
- **THEN** certificate issuer, protocol, and validity are shown

### Requirement: Performance Timing
The system SHALL track timing metrics for each request.

#### Scenario: Request timing recorded
- **WHEN** any request is made
- **THEN** TTFB and total time are recorded
- **AND** timing is displayed in seconds

### Requirement: Server and Technology Detection
The system SHALL identify web server and technology from headers.

#### Scenario: Server header present
- **WHEN** response includes Server header
- **THEN** server type and version are identified
- **AND** related technologies are detected
