# Comprehensive Redirect Analyzer Upgrade

## Why

The current redirect checker provides basic redirect chain analysis, but lacks advanced features that professional SEO tools and developers need. Competitive analysis shows that leading redirect checkers offer comprehensive HTTP header analysis, security assessments, bulk processing, detailed SEO insights, and export capabilities. To establish this tool as the market leader, we need to implement these advanced features while maintaining excellent UX and performance.

Market research indicates that users need:
- Complete HTTP header visibility and analysis
- Security header validation (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- SSL certificate information and validation
- Bulk URL processing for site-wide audits
- Detailed SEO impact analysis (canonical tags, robots directives, hreflang)
- Export functionality for reporting and documentation
- Visual redirect chain diagrams
- JavaScript redirect detection
- Performance metrics and timing breakdowns
