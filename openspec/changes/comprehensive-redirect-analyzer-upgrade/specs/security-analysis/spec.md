# Security Analysis Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Security Headers Detection
The system SHALL detect and analyze security-related HTTP headers.

#### Scenario: HSTS header detected
- **WHEN** a response includes Strict-Transport-Security header
- **THEN** the header is identified and its configuration is displayed
- **AND** max-age value and directives are shown

#### Scenario: CSP header analysis
- **WHEN** a response includes Content-Security-Policy header
- **THEN** the policy is parsed and displayed
- **AND** policy directives are summarized

#### Scenario: X-Frame-Options detected
- **WHEN** a response includes X-Frame-Options header
- **THEN** the clickjacking protection status is indicated
- **AND** the directive (DENY, SAMEORIGIN, ALLOW-FROM) is shown

### Requirement: Security Scoring System
The system SHALL calculate a security score (0-100) based on presence and configuration of security headers.

#### Scenario: High security score
- **WHEN** all recommended security headers are present and properly configured
- **THEN** security score is 90-100
- **AND** a green indicator shows excellent security

#### Scenario: Low security score
- **WHEN** multiple security headers are missing
- **THEN** security score is below 50
- **AND** a red indicator shows poor security
- **AND** specific missing headers are listed

### Requirement: Security Recommendations
The system SHALL provide actionable recommendations to improve security posture.

#### Scenario: Missing HSTS recommendation
- **WHEN** an HTTPS URL lacks Strict-Transport-Security header
- **THEN** a recommendation is displayed to add HSTS
- **AND** example header configuration is provided

#### Scenario: Weak CSP recommendation
- **WHEN** CSP header includes 'unsafe-inline' or 'unsafe-eval'
- **THEN** a warning about weak CSP is shown
- **AND** recommendations to strengthen the policy are provided

### Requirement: SSL/TLS Protocol Analysis
The system SHALL analyze SSL/TLS protocol version and cipher strength.

#### Scenario: Strong TLS configuration
- **WHEN** a site uses TLS 1.3 with strong ciphers
- **THEN** the configuration is marked as secure
- **AND** protocol version and cipher suite are displayed

#### Scenario: Weak or deprecated protocol
- **WHEN** a site uses TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, or SSLv3
- **THEN** a critical warning is displayed
- **AND** recommendation to upgrade to TLS 1.2+ is shown

### Requirement: Mixed Content Detection
The system SHALL detect and warn about mixed content issues in redirect chains.

#### Scenario: HTTPS to HTTP downgrade
- **WHEN** a redirect chain includes HTTPS â†’ HTTP transition
- **THEN** a security warning is displayed
- **AND** potential MITM risk is explained
- **AND** recommendation to use HTTPS throughout is provided
